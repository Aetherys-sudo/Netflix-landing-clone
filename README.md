NETFIX LANDING CLONE

This webpage is my attempt of rebuilding the Netflix front page using HTML, CSS and JS. 

This project is based on the previous Netflix landing page design. The page has most of the functionalities that the previous one had, from a front-end perspective (there is no back-end communication at all). 

It contains the interactive parts that the original page has, slightly adapted in some places. 

The code is not a full copy of the functionality that the original page offers, as most of the sizes of the containers and such, have been decided going forward without checking the original.

The result is a page that emulates the original, but has it's own slight twists.
